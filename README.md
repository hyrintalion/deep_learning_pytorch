## This is my learning project
I'm studying Pytorch and Deep Learning and in this repo I'm going to keep my exercises and show progress for additional motivation. Yaaay!

#### I'm my journey I use
1. This practical course
* https://youtu.be/Z_ikDlimN6A?si=uGjqTNTCsCuJuxkm
* https://www.learnpytorch.io/

2. And this book
https://www.amazon.co.uk/Deep-Learning-Pytorch-Eli-Stevens/dp/1617295264

3. And this more academic course by Andrew Ng
https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction

4. Also, from time to time I'm taking look on https://www.kaggle.com/ challenges, but looks like it is a bit too early for that

If by the chance you want to join me, write to @hyrintalion in telegram or just comment something here.
