## This is my learning project
I'm studying Pytorch and Deep Learning and in this repo I'm going to keep my exercises and show progress for additional motivation. Yaaay!

#### Im my journey I use
* This practival course

* And this book

* And this more academic course by Andrew Ng

* Also from time to time I taking look on https://www.kaggle.com/ challenges, but looks like it is a but too early for that
